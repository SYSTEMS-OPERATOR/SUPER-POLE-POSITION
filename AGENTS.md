# SOPHY Coding Guide

Welcome, SOPHY! This file provides a few notes for future contributions.

## Coding Style
- Follow PEP8 for all Python code.
- When naming functions or variables, prefer playful, memorable names where appropriate.
- Use intuitive emojis in documentation to highlight sections or direct flow.

## Commit Guidelines
- Write commit messages in present-tense imperative.
- Keep each commit focused on a single topic.

## Testing
Run the following before committing:

```
python -m py_compile $(git ls-files '*.py')
```

Feel free to expand these checks as the project evolves.
