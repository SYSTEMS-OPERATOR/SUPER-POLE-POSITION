# Contributing

- Run `pytest -n auto` for quicker test runs.
- If determinism tests fail, ensure seeds propagate through `PolePositionEnv.reset`.

## Running Tests

Use the following commands before pushing changes:

```bash
python -m py_compile $(git ls-files '*.py')
pytest -q
```

Seeds should flow through `PolePositionEnv.reset(seed)` so deterministic tests pass with repeated runs. Baseline images can be regenerated by running `pytest --force-regen`.

If `pygame` or other optional libraries are missing, install requirements with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
