# 🎮 Gameplay FAQ

## How do I drive?

- **Throttle**: Press the **Up Arrow** to accelerate.
- **Brake**: Press the **Down Arrow** to slow down.
- **Steer**: Use **Left** and **Right Arrows** to turn.
- **Shift Gear**: Tap **Z** to shift down and **X** to shift up just like the arcade shifter.

## Tips

- Use gentle steering to avoid skids.
- Finish four laps as fast as possible to top the leaderboard.
- For touchscreens try `--virtual-joystick`.

Enjoy the ride! 🏁
