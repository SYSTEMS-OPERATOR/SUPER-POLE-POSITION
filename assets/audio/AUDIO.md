# Audio Assets

This directory stores small WAV files for sound effects and voice lines.
No binary files are tracked. Run `generate_placeholders.py` to create
simple chiptune-style samples if real audio is unavailable.

- `engine_loop.wav` – looping engine sound
- `skid.wav` – tire skid effect
- `crash.wav` – crash explosion
- `checkpoint.wav` – checkpoint chime
- `menu_tick.wav` – short beep for menu navigation
- `shift.wav` – mechanical click when shifting gear
- `prepare.wav` – "Prepare to qualify" voice
- `final_lap.wav` – "Final lap" call
- `goal.wav` – finish line voice
- `bgm.wav` – attract mode background music

Generated WAVs use a 32 kHz sample rate and remain under 50 kB each.
